## Description
During this project week we institute the _Black Box Society_. :beers:

The overarching themes of this project week are [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) (open source intelligence) and webscraping. With different scripts and tools, it is possible to explore and investigate the web and its data in a different way. OSINT data is collected from publicly available sources. In the intelligence community, the term &#39;open&#39; refers to publicly available public sources (as opposed to secret or clandestine sources). With OSINT and webscraping it becomes possible to pick data that you can&#39;t immediately find with a google search. An example is that you can download all Instagram pictures or tweets from a certain user.

The obtained data is then used as input for a [speed project](http://fffff.at/speed-project/). We will provide various resources to translate the data into, for example, coordinates to work with the drawing machine, use them to create online apps, or to visualize them with [TouchDesigner](https://www.derivative.ca/).
