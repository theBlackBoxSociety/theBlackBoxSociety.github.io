*the Black Box Society* is a codelab with teachers and (former) students [Media art](http://mediakunst.be) from [KASK, the School of Arts of University College Ghent](https://www.schoolofartsgent.be/) with whom we want to write and share code that can be applied within art and design projects. All the BBS code and ideas will be published on the [BBS github page](https://github.com/theBlackBoxSociety) and are open source.
